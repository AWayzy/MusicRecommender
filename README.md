Machine Learning Class Project, Music Recommender Web App

Here is a link to the video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXgaTgjQSsY 

For this project, I was in a group of 8 people. My task was first collecting data, then cleaning the data for the machine learning team to work on. I gathered data from the Spotify Million Songs Dataset and Million Playlist Dataset, then cleaned and formatted the data to the specifications of ML team. 

My second task was to build the web application for the project. Other than the actual implementation of the association rules, I wrote the rest of the page, included the playlist builder and song search functions.
